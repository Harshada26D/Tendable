# Tendable

# Brief Discription- 
Over the past 7 years, we have helped energise tens of thousands of front line staff across the world by providing the best, most simple to use mobile inspection and auditing tools that help educate and engage staff as they do their work and make things better. And since we engage front line staff way beyond “one-size fits all” compliance tools, management get much better quality data using Tendable. Across all settings and internationally, we can help drive a real change in culture

# Task- 
1. Confirm accessibility of the top-level menus: Home, Our Story, Our Solution, and Why
Tendable.
2. Verify that the "Request a Demo" button is present and active on each of the
aforementioned top-level menu pages.
3. Navigate to the "Contact Us" section, choose "Marketing", and complete the form—
excluding the "Message" field. On submission, an error should arise. Ensure your scriptconfirms the error message's appearance. If the error is displayed, mark the test as PASS. Ifabsent, it's a FAIL.
4. In the event the test for point 3 fails (meaning no error message is displayed when the "Message" field is empty), draft a bug report. This can be a Word document that you'll upload to GitHub alongside your code.
